# Overview
It is a repository where I put my projects and examples of packages that I find useful for my work

## sql_with_dask_example.py
dask is a Python package that can handle huge dataset with parallel computing. 

It has many functionalities, but I mainly use it when querying a large dataset, where I know it needs to be split into several small batches to avoid running the risk of breaking my PC or the server. <br />

Below is the screenshot of the result of the py file, showing how much time it saves with dask comparing to for loop. <br />
